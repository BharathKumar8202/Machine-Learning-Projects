# Python Machine Learning Projects

## Task 1: Classification

### Introduction to the Dataset
This dataset offers a comprehensive view of player behavior in online gaming environments. The goal is to predict player engagement levels—categorized as 'High', 'Medium', and 'Low'—using classification models. Insights from this analysis can enhance game design, marketing strategies, and player retention mechanisms.

### Objective
The primary objective is to build classification models to predict player engagement levels (High, Medium, Low).

### Result
- A summary of the classification performance of KNN and Random Forest algorithms.
- Detailed discussion on the strengths, weaknesses, and suitability of each model for this dataset.
- Recommendations based on the results to optimize gaming strategies.

## Task 2: Clustering

### Introduction to the Dataset
The dataset includes key water quality parameters such as pH, dissolved oxygen, temperature, and turbidity. These metrics are essential indicators of water conditions that impact aquatic life diversity and abundance.

### Objective
This project aims to analyze water quality data to identify clusters of aquatic life based on key water quality metrics. Understanding these clusters helps uncover patterns that affect aquatic ecosystems.

### Result
- Comparison of clustering performance between K-Means and Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering using Silhouette Scores.
- Visualizations (e.g., scatter plots or dendrograms) to illustrate the formed groups.
- Recommendation of the clustering method with the highest Silhouette Score as the final model.

## Task 3: Sentiment Analysis

### Introduction to the Dataset
The dataset comprises 20,000 hotel reviews from TripAdvisor, offering insights into customer experiences. Each review is accompanied by a rating, allowing analysis of factors contributing to positive or negative hotel experiences.

### Objective
- Predict the overall sentiment (positive or negative) of hotel reviews using Sentiment Analysis.
- Provide actionable insights from negative reviews to help hotels enhance customer satisfaction.
- Visualize frequently used words in positive and negative reviews through word clouds for comparative analysis.

### Output
- A Multinomial Naive Bayes model to predict review sentiment with high accuracy.
- Separate word clouds for positive and negative reviews, summarizing frequently mentioned terms.
- Summary of common negative themes (e.g., service issues, cleanliness concerns) to help hotel management address customer dissatisfaction.
