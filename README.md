# Python Machine Learning Projects

## Crime Against Women

### Introduction to the Dataset
This project analyzes crimes against women in India, using a dataset sourced from Kaggle. The dataset categorizes various types of crimes, providing insights into trends, geographical distribution, and patterns of offenses over the years.

### Objective
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify trends in crimes against women.
Categorize and analyze different types of crimes, such as domestic violence, sexual harassment, and dowry-related offenses.
Visualize crime hotspots and trends over time to aid awareness and policy recommendations.

### Methodology
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, normalized categorical variables, and ensured dataset consistency.
Descriptive Statistics: Analyzed crime distribution across states, years, and categories.
Visualizations: Created heatmaps, bar charts, and line graphs to highlight crime trends and regional disparities.
Output

### Tools & Libraries
Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
Google Collab: Used for analysis and visualization

### Conclusion
This project provides data-driven insights into crimes against women in India, supporting awareness initiatives and informing policymakers to implement better safety measures.

## Gen Z Dating Analysis

### Introduction to the Dataset
